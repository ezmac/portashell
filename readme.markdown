# portable shell

I just reworked this and I'm tired, so disclaimer on the following notes.

It's docker container; it's got my dotfiles repo; it runs the install scripts like I think they should run.  

Fortunately for you, I can quote simone giertz. "I feel like this would be so much easier if I just knew what I was doing"

This thing makes tonnes of assumptions but it might be ok if you just use it as a learning experience. 

Either way, it works for me and I need it to be public, so here we are.
